Hi Professor Marintchev!

This repository includes the code for calculating the mean protein size and median mRNA coding sequence length.

I tried to include a lot of comments to explain the approach I took, but please let me know if any parts look incorrect or messy. I also uploaded the dataset below.

I rarely use GitHub, so it still feels relatively unfamiliar, but I'm sure I will get the hang of it very soon.
